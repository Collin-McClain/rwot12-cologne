# Verifiable Credentials for Company Identification using eIDAS Qualified Seal Certificates

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this research proposal is to explore the benefits and implementation of using verifiable credentials, specifically eIDAS Qualified Seal (QSeal) certificates, for company identification. Verifiable credentials offer numerous advantages, such as enhanced security, trustworthiness, and interoperability. This proposal aims to investigate the creation of a strong binding between a self-declared company profile and the QSeal certificate, as well as the potential integration of Gaia-X's self-declared company profile for alternative verification. Additionally, the inclusion of a verified company bank account verifiable credential will be examined.

## 2. Research Objectives
The primary objectives of this research proposal are as follows:
a. To explore the benefits of utilizing verifiable credentials, specifically signed with eIDAS Qualified Seal (QSeal) certificates, for company identification.
b. To investigate methods to establish a strong binding between a self-declared company profile and the QSeal certificate to enhance trust and reliability.
c. To examine the potential integration of Gaia-X's self-declared company profile as an alternative approach to company identification.
d. To evaluate the feasibility of incorporating a verified company bank account verifiable credential for enhanced verification.

## 3. Methodology
To achieve the research objectives, the following methodology will be employed:
a. Literature Review: Conduct an extensive review of existing literature, scholarly articles, and industry reports related to verifiable credentials, eIDAS Qualified Seal certificates, company identification, and Gaia-X's self-declared company profile. Analyze the benefits, challenges, and best practices associated with these topics.
b. Technical Integration: Investigate the technical aspects of creating a strong binding between a self-declared company profile and the QSeal certificate. 
c. Feasibility Analysis: Assess the feasibility and practicality of incorporating a verified company bank account verifiable credential as an additional layer of verification. Analyze the potential benefits and challenges associated with this approach.

## 4. Expected Outcomes
The research is expected to yield the following outcomes:
a. A comprehensive understanding of the benefits of using verifiable credentials, specifically signed with eIDAS Qualified Seal certificates, for company identification.
b. Recommendations for establishing a strong binding between a self-declared company profile and the QSeal certificate, ensuring enhanced trust and reliability.
c. Insights into the potential integration of Gaia-X's self-declared company profile as an alternative approach to company identification, with considerations for interoperability and standardization.
d. An evaluation of the feasibility and advantages of incorporating a verified company bank account verifiable credential for enhanced verification.

## 5. Significance and Potential Impact
The proposed research holds significant importance and potential impact:
a. Increased Trust and Reliability: A strong binding between a self-declared company profile and the QSeal certificate enhances trustworthiness, fostering secure business transactions and collaborations.
b. Streamlined Processes: Verifiable credentials streamline the company identification process, reducing administrative burdens, and increasing operational efficiency.
